# PyGraphistry Router

Use this skill as a dispatcher to specialized skills.

## Route By Intent
- Setup/auth/first plot from tables: use `pygraphistry-core`.
- Styling/layout/static output/privacy and sharing: use `pygraphistry-visualization`.
- Pattern matching, hops/chains, predicates, remote graph queries: use `pygraphistry-gfql`.
- UMAP/DBSCAN/embedding/anomaly and graph-AI notebooks: use `pygraphistry-ai`.
- Database/platform integrations (Neo4j, Splunk, Kusto, Databricks, SQL, etc.): use `pygraphistry-connectors`.

## Fast Targeted Fetch Protocol
- Start from `references/pygraphistry-readthedocs-toc.md`; do not crawl broad docs first.
- Use `references/pygraphistry-readthedocs-top-level.tsv` for section-level shortcuts.
- Pick exactly one primary skill and at most two secondary docs before fetching content.
- Do one batched discovery read first (TOC + top-level index), then pick targets.
- After discovery, do at most one deep-page read per iteration.
- Prefer section indexes (`.../gfql/index.html`, `.../visualization/index.html`) before deep pages.
- For routing replies, prefer ReadTheDocs URLs (`https://pygraphistry.readthedocs.io/...`) over GitHub/local file paths unless the user explicitly asks for source code links.
- Keep the first routing response compact (typically 3-5 lines): selected skill + top links.
- Escalate to deeper page fetches only after the user confirms direction or asks for detail.
- Avoid serial micro-reads across many files when one batched lookup can answer routing.
- Avoid blind full dumps (`cat *`, full sitemap dumps) that bloat context without improving routing quality.
- For canonical URL verification, prefer local snapshot evidence first; use web fallback when the user requests freshness or local mapping is missing.

## Default Safety Rules
- Read credentials from environment variables; do not hardcode secrets in tracked files.
- Prefer `api=3` for modern features.
- Prefer a plain `type` column on both nodes and edges for legend/category defaults.
- Set explicit privacy mode before sharing links for sensitive data.
- For large graphs, reduce columns/rows before upload and visualize focused subgraphs first.
